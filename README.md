# Unveiling Spatial Trends: K-Means Analysis of Police Shootings in US

## Project Overview
This project applies K-Means clustering to analyze fatal police shootings across the continental United States, aiming to identify spatial patterns and potential regional hotspots. The dataset, although extensive, presented challenges due to missing values in critical geographical coordinates.

## Key Questions
 - How to handle missing geographical coordinates for accurate spatial analysis?
 - What is the optimal number of clusters, and how do we validate this choice?
 - Can clustering reveal meaningful insights into the distribution of police shootings and underlying societal or systemic factors?

## Findings
- The analysis identified three distinct clusters corresponding to specific geographical regions.
- Clusters revealed frequent police shootings in the Eastern and Western regions, particularly in major cities like New York, Houston, and Los Angeles.
- There is significant variation within clusters, suggesting a widespread distribution of incidents within each region.

## Conclusion
The clustering analysis of fatal police shootings in the US unveils significant spatial patterns, with pronounced concentrations in urban areas. These findings underscore the need for further investigation into socio-economic, demographic, and law enforcement factors to understand and address the underlying causes of these incidents.
